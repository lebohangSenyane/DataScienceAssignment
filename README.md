# DataScienceAssignment
This data science assignment is based on exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, PCA reduction and model classification.
I used the adult income dataset fom Kaggle for this. 
Model classification includes SVM, Random Forest and Logistic Regression.
There is comparison of the ROC Curve and AUC, determining which one is best and also prediction of income using a sample dataset.
